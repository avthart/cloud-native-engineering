# cloud-native-engineering

Cloud computing changed the required skills for software engineers and system administrators. A cloud native approach requires new skills, technology and architectures to take advantage of the new world aka `the cloud`.

From the Cloud Native Computing Foundation:
> Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.

> These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageble and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high impact changes frequently and predictable with minimum toil.
