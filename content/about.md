**Cloud Native Consultant at KPN ICT Consulting. Husband and father of two boys. Cycling. Music. Technology.**

Passionated about Software Engineering, Cloud Native, Domain Driven Design, Agile and Security.

Starting November 1st, I will work as Cloud Native Consultant at KPN ICT Consulting. I like to help customers in their journey to Cloud Native with sharing my knowlegde and expertise in this new world. 

I have worked for more than 15 years for a SaaS Healthcare company based in the Netherlands within different engineering and pre-sales roles. In the last 4 years I have worked as Tech Lead/Principal Engineer. As Principal Engineer, I provided technical leadership throughout the software development lifecycle and was responsible for providing guidance and oversight to multiple devops teams. In this role I was contributing to the core products and the cloud-native platform. 

As Architect of the cloud-native platform, I was responsible for the vision, roadmap and implementation. In this role I needed to work closely with the feature teams because they were the most important stakeholders.

This cloud-native platform made it easy for engineers to package, deploy, and manage scalable and reliable applications (e.g. microservices). Besides that it addresses the significant challenges in developing and managing cloud applications. 

I have initiated and/or contributed to the following core projects:

* Cloud Native with Docker, Mesos/Marathon, Consul, Prometheus, and NGINX Plus
* Continuous Delivery with Gitlab CI/CD
* Datacenter automation with Ansible and Terraform
* Microservices architecture with Java, Spring Boot and Spring Cloud
* Distributed logging and tracing using NGINX and Spring Cloud Sleuth
* Single sign-on and authorization with Keycloak
* Transition to DevOps
