I am interested in domain-driven design, microservices, cloud native, agile and security.

I am currently working with the following technologies: Java, Spring Boot/Cloud, Golang, Docker, Mesos/Marathon, Consul, Prometheus, Keycloak, NGINX, Ansible, Terraform, Gitlab, Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ.
