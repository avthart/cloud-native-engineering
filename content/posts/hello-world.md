I am 36 years old, living in The Netherlands, husband and father of two boys (4 and 2 years old). Love to cylce both road and off-road, listen music on vinyl or spotify and the most important, spend time with my family and friends.

Starting November 1st, I will work as Cloud Native Consultant at KPN ICT Consulting. I like to help customers in their journey to Cloud Native with sharing my knowlegde and expertise in this new world. 

I have worked for more than 15 years for a SaaS Healthcare company based in the Netherlands within different engineering and pre-sales roles. In the last 4 years I have worked as Tech Lead/Principal Engineer. As Principal Engineer, I provided technical leadership throughout the software development lifecycle and was responsible for providing guidance and oversight to multiple devops teams. In this role I was contributing to the core products and the cloud-native platform. 

On this blog, I will share my knowledge, experiences and updates on software engineering, cloud native and (open source) technology. 

Have fun! If you have any questions or remarks, do not hesitate to contact me.
