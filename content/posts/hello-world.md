This is the first post of my new blog. Hope you will enjoy reading my blog posts, but first a short introduction.

I am 36 years old and living in Nootdorp in The Netherlands. Husband and father of two boys (4 and 2 years old). Love to cycle both road (De Rosa R838) and off-road (Merida Big Seven). Listen to music on vinyl or spotify. But most important, I like spend time with my family and friends.

Starting November 1st, I will work as Cloud Native Consultant at KPN ICT Consulting. I like to help customers in their journey to Cloud Native with sharing my knowlegde and expertise in this new world. 

I have worked for more than 15 years for a SaaS Healthcare company based in the Netherlands within different engineering and pre-sales roles. In the last 4 years I have worked as Tech Lead/Principal Engineer. As Principal Engineer, I provided technical leadership throughout the software development lifecycle and was technically responsible for multiple devops teams. In this role I was contributing to the core products and the cloud-native platform. You can read more about what I worked on [here](/about/).

On this blog, I will share my knowledge, thoughts and updates on software engineering, cloud native and (open source) technology. 

Have fun! If you have any questions or remarks, do not hesitate to contact me.
